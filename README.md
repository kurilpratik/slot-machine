## ðŸŽ° Slot-Machine
### A terminal based slot machine written in JS

Example:
<br>
D | D | D <br>
B | B | A <br>
C | C | A <br>

Here the user wins in line number 1 and since D has a mulitplier of 1.5, the bet is multiplied by 1.5

## Learnings
- Looping through an Object using Object.entries and accessing its key-value pair
```bash
for ( const [symbol, count] of Object.entries(SYMBOLS_COUNT) ) {
    for (let i=0; i<count; i++) {
        symbols.push(symbol);
    }
}
```
- Using the spread operator(...) -> It is used to create a shallow copy of arrays, objects and strings.
```bash
const reelSymbols = [...symbols];
```
- transposing a matrix

## Extensions
- [x] Add winnings and bet losses to balance
